# VR-Play

VR-Play is a visual programming language (similar to Scratch) for creating 3D stories, animations and games. It help children learn fundamentals of computer programming (loops, conditions, algorithms, etc) while having fun.

Disclaimer : Most of the code in this repo was written at a 24 hour hackathon (InOut 6.0). The code quality is very poor, and I will be fixing the code quality in the days to come. 

## How to get started with the development version ?

1. Install the prerequisites

```
git clone https://github.com/anubhavp28/VR-Play
cd VR-Play
npm install --global live-server-https
npm install
```

2. Run the server

```
npm start
```

3. A browser window should automatically open now, on your computer. Now point your mobile phone at the ip address of this local server. 

4. Insert your phone into any Google Cardboard certificed VR headset.

5. Enjoy!
